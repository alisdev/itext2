This is a fork of the original iText 2.1.7 source code, as downloaded from
http://olex.openlogic.com/packages/itext/2.1.7. The original authors released 
this version of iText under both LGPL v2 and MPL v 1.1 licenses. This 
distribution retains those licenses. You can read the terms of those licenses
at the link above.
 
Subsequent versions of iText were released under Affero GPL and GPL. Those 
licenses govern iText version 5.0 and later. It appears the wgen-iText 
github repo forked from iText, 5.0.2.
